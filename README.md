# Bear_robotics_final_Q

Implemented in python. Certain functions needs to be overriden, docstrings for every function provided. An ATM class was implemented, so making an object of the class such as x = ATM() should call the right function and activate the transaction. Note this can be done only after the required functions are overriden.
